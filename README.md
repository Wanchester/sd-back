# Sports Dashboard: Back-end implementation

Put all the source files into the `src` folder.

To start the development environment, use `npm run dev`.

To build the project into JavaScript for Node.js, use `npm run build`.

Use `npm start` only if there is already a build in the `dist` folder.

Make sure to always run `npm run lint` to check for linting errors before committing.
